Problem Statement: 
Suppose you were to drive from point A to point B. 
Your gas tank with a capacity C, when full, holds enough gas to travel m miles. 
You have a precise map that gives distances between gas stations along the route. 
Let d1 < d2 < â€¦. < dn be the locations of all the gas stations along the route where 
di is the distance from point A to the gas station. 

You can assume that the distance between neighboring gas stations is at most m miles.
In the case that the rate at which you can fill your tank at a gas station is r (in liters/minute), 
so if you stop to fill your tank from 2 liters to 8 liters, you would have to stop for 6/r minutes. 
Give the most efficient greedy solution, where you need to minimize the total time you stop for gas filling?
