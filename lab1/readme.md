## Task 1:

Create 3 separate text files as follows:

1. Consists of n elements in increasing order in the range (1, 1000).
2. Consists of n randomly generated numbers in the range (1, 1000).
3. Consists of n randomly generated numbers in the range (106, 109)

## Task 2:

Write a program on Linear Search for n = 1000000.

Input array: Read the text file one at a time.

Key: User input

## Task 3:

Compute the total time for performing Linear search.

Make a table of results.

PS: In case you are getting time as 0, then try running q iterations of the program and take the average time.
